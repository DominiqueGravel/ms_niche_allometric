Abstract = {{Patterns of species richness, prevalence and abundance of ectoparasites
   have rarely been investigated at both the levels of populations and
   species of hosts. Here, we investigated the effects in changes in small
   mammal density on species richness, abundance and prevalence of
   ectoparasitic fleas. The comparative analyses were conducted for
   different small mammal species and among several populations during a
   long-term survey. We tested the hypothesis that an increase in host
   density should be linked with an increase in parasite species richness
   both among host species and among populations within host species, as
   predicted by epidemiological models. We also used host species density
   data from literature. We found that host density has a major influence
   on the species richness of ectoparasite communities of small mammals
   among host populations. We found no relationship between data of host
   density from the literature and parasite species richness. In contrast
   with epidemiological hypotheses. we found no relationships between
   abundance, or prevalence, and host density, either among host species or
   among host populations. Moreover, a decrease in abundance of fleas in
   relation with an increase in host density was observed for two mammal
   species (Apodemus agrarius and A. flavicollis). The decrease or the lack
   of increase in flea abundance in relation with an increase in host
   density suggests anti-parasitic behavioural activities such as grooming.}},
